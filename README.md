Traditional escape rooms are great fun.  They're also very location-specific, and they require serious infrastructure to set up and maintain.  If you want to run one of your own at a party or event, you're largely out of luck.

*The Team from Turtle Bay* is an escape room for which the setup boils down to "Gather four laptops."  Those laptops, plus this software, are almost everything you need to put an escape room experience together.  Best of all, none of the puzzles are significantly physical, so there's no risk of players damaging borrowed equipment or the space itself.

## Setup

Download the most recent version of the escape room from the Releases section.  Further instructions, including required equipment (four laptops, four USB sticks, and equipment to play a video -- possibly including a fifth laptop -- plus some other minor things) can be found in the "Checklist" and "Technical" files inside the "Docs" folder.  Read the checklist file first.
