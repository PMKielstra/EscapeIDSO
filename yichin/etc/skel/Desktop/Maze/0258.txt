there are three numbers in the main passkey

i have the first one
i stored it on a remote server at 192.168.2.32
hack it

trevor has the second one

carol has the third
she said she hid it with a "photo quiz"
no idea what thats about

put them together in the format "<me>-<trevor>-<carol>"
so if my number were 1
and trevors were 2
and carols were 43
the main passkey would be 1-2-43
