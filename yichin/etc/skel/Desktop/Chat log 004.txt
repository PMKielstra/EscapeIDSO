CHAT TRANSCRIPT

YICHIN: why isnt the text processor in beta yet
YICHIN: you said it would be done two days ago
TREVOR: well
TREVOR: i spoke with carol
CAROL:  we arent sure about the direction of the project
YICHIN: we rob banks, ok?
YICHIN: you knew we were going to rob banks when we started this
CAROL:  we thought you meant electronically
TREVOR: build a super-ai to hack all the bank accounts
CAROL:  but then why does she need to read maps?
TREVOR: why does she have to talk this much?
CAROL:  and then you told me at lunch to teach her to recognze guns
CAROL:  are we robbing real banks?
YICHIN: whats the problem?
YICHIN: finding a way through computer security or physical security
YICHIN: no difference
TREVOR: people could get hurt is the difference
YICHIN: not in most bank robberies they dont
TREVOR: but you dont need an ai to plan most bank robberies
TREVOR: youre looking to take on the big places
YICHIN: and why not?
YICHIN: if we hack money out of someones account then they might be able to trace it
YICHIN: but if we steal gold then we just have gold
YICHIN: more secure
CAROL:  and lots more dangerous
YICHIN: so you want out
CAROL:  i think we kind of do
TREVOR: yeah
YICHIN: youre happy to steal money but not happy to kill for it
YICHIN: well
YICHIN: the police care a lot more about property than about life
YICHIN: even if you thought you were just going to hack bank accounts
YICHIN: thats still inconveniencing the rich
YICHIN: and thats a much bigger crime than any kind of murder
YICHIN: so leave if you want
YICHIN: but theyll still come after you
YICHIN: or keep working and ill cover your tracks along with mine
YICHIN: got it, noobs?
