YICHIN: great work with lilith today, people
YICHIN: and i only sort of mean that sarcastically
YICHIN: we should have her up and running properly within a few weeks
CAROL:  actually, i wanted to talk to you about her
TREVOR: carol and i think she's kind of creepy
YICHIN: of course she's creepy
YICHIN: she's a simulated mind that's going to help us rob banks
YICHIN: what did you think she was going to be
TREVOR: less like... like what she is, i guess
YICHIN: look
YICHIN: trevor, you're here because i need an expert on text processing so i can teach her to talk right
YICHIN: carol, you're here because i need an image processing person so i can teach her to read maps and stuff
YICHIN: neither of you know anything about ai
YICHIN: apparently trevor doesn't even know not to put the password to the ai in a big fat pdf on his desktop
YICHIN: so what i say pretty much goes
YICHIN: get rekt, noobs
[YICHIN has logged off]
TREVOR: not very nice, is she?
CAROL:  wait, is it true about the pdf?
TREVOR: it's fine.  you can't just read it.  you gotta know what to do.
