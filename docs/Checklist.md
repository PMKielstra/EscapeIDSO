# Escape Room Organizer's Checklist

If you plan to play the escape room, do not read this document. It contains spoilers.

## Equipment

* A space to hold the event, including:
  
  * An area for each new team to view the introductory video.
  
  * The room proper, which should be closed off from the rest of the world but doesn't have to actually lock.
  
  * Power outlets in both areas. Internet connectivity is not required.

* Four Windows laptops. Warn all their owners that, while the software for this escape room has been carefully designed to leave no trace once the event is over, there is always a risk, and that they should back up their data beforehand. The laptops should be less than six years old for optimum performance. They should have standard QWERTY keyboards -- laptops from non-English-speaking countries won't work. US layout is preferred; UK layout is possible but might lead to minor quirks.

* Chargers for all four laptops.

* Enough extension cords that all four chargers can be plugged in at once, while still allowing participants to pick up and move laptops to some extent.

* Four USB sticks, each at least 1GB in size. If the laptops have DVD drives, you can use blank DVDs instead. The technical PDF will tell you what to do with these.

* A TV or a projector with speakers for playing the intro video, plus whatever other tech is needed to make it work. This will probably require a fifth computer. The video does not have captions, so audio must be clear and loud.

* A hard copy printout of the solutions PDF, or, at the very least, a reliable digital way of accessing it.

## Before the day

* Find someone to act as the technical expert. This largely requires booting the laptops using the ISO files. If you know what that means without looking it up, you're more than capable.
  
  * The technical expert should follow the instructions in the technical PDF.

* Verify that at least one laptop has a functioning webcam -- and that that webcam still works when that laptop has been booted to the relevant ISO. Further instructions for making this check are available in the technical PDF.
  
  * If none have working webcams, you can use a USB webcam instead. Check that your USB webcam still works when booted to the relevant ISO.

* Plan out your character. You will be playing the local IDSO liaison. How you want to do that is up to you. You should make yourself contactable by players in the room without being in it with them. If you have an intercom or a landline phone, that's perfect. Otherwise, just wait around outside the door and tell players to stick their heads out if they need a hint.

* Decide how long players will have.

* Play the intro video for yourself so you know what you should be looking for when you set up the TV or projector.

## On the day

* Play the entire intro video and make sure that it looks and sounds acceptable.

* Set up all four laptops in the escape room area. Boot all four to the proper ISOs as described in the technical PDF.

* Run through the entire escape room following the instructions in the solutions PDF. Ensure that every puzzle shows up as it should and that it can be solved as intended.

* Turn off all laptops, then boot them to the proper ISOs.

## Between every group

* Turn off all laptops, then boot them to the proper ISOs.
